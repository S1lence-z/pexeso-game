# Pexeso Game

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the classic Pexeso game developed using C# and Windows Forms. Pexeso, also known as Concentration, Memory, or Match Match, is a card-matching game where players need to find pairs of matching cards.

## Features

- **Customizable Game Grid:** You can choose the size of the game grid with different numbers of rows and columns (3 options).
- **Random Card Shuffling:** The game shuffles the cards randomly at the start to ensure a unique experience each time you play.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Click on cards to reveal them and match pairs. If the cards match, they remain face-up; otherwise, they are hidden again.
- **Winning Condition:** The game continues until all card pairs are matched. Upon winning, you can choose to restart or change the grid size.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by selecting the desired grid size (number of rows and columns).
2. Click the "Start Game" button to begin playing.
3. Click on any card to reveal it. Try to remember the cards you reveal.
4. Click on another card to find a matching pair. If they match, they will stay face-up. If not, both cards will be hidden again.
5. Continue matching pairs until all cards are face-up to win the game.
6. You can restart the game or change the grid size after winning.
